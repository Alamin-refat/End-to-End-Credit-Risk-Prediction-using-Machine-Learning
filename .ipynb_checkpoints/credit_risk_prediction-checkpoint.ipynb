    "\n",
    "Credit risk prediction is a critical task in the banking and financial services industry. Financial institutions provide loans to customers with the expectation that they will repay the borrowed amount on time. However, some borrowers fail to meet their repayment obligations, leading to loan defaults and financial losses.\n",
    "This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan based on their financial and demographic information. By identifying high-risk borrowers in advance, lenders can make informed loan approval decisions, reduce potential losses, and improve overall risk management.\n",
